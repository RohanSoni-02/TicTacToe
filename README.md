# Overview
A simple, console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python using object-oriented programming principles. This project demonstrates the structure of a basic game loop (input, update, render) and serves as an educational example for understanding classes, methods, and game logic. The game allows a human player to play against a basic AI that makes random moves.
